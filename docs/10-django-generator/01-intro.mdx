# UI Presentation

The service provides an intuitive UI that aims to make the process as simple as possible. Here are the main sections:

## âœ… [Generator UI](https://app-generator.dev/django/) 

- Sidebar provides the links to the Generator, Tasks page, SignIN and Support
- Main Area divided in for cards with the `GENERATE` button at the bottom 
- **Design Section** (top-left) empowers the user to select the design 
- **DB Settings** (top-right) where the user can design the tables, extended user model and activate the API for each model 
- **MISC Settings** (bottom-left) for Docker and Authentication 
- **Project Summary** - the section used to visualize current props of the starter

At the bottom, the GENERATE button triggers the generation process and redirects the user to the Tasks page.

## âœ… Compile Sources 

The recommended way to use the generated code is to access the GitHub repository, download or fork the project and follow up the build instructions as presented on README file. 

As a sample, we can take access this [starter](https://github.com/appseed-projects4/django-soft-7b923a2f-1487-40ae-998b-87fef219648e) generated by the platform and simply execute the steps: 

### Clone the Sources 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/appseed-projects4/django-soft-7b923a2f-1487-40ae-998b-87fef219648e.git
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Migrate DB

```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
```

### Generate the API

```bash
$ python manage.py generate-api -f
```

### Start the APP 

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

### Access the API

At this point, the generated starter should run in the browser and the generated code ready to be extended with more features and modules.
