# Deployment Options

Once the project is generated, here are some quick options for **LIVE Deployment**.

- [Deploy Django on AWS](./django-aws) using `DeployPRO` service 
- [Deploy Django on Azure](./django-azure) using `DeployPRO` service 
- [Deploy Django on DigitalOcean](./django-digitalocean) using `DeployPRO` service 

For newcomers, [DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev/) is a service that aims to simplify the deployment process, empowering businesses to deploy, monitor, and scale applications 
without the burden of infrastructure complexities.
