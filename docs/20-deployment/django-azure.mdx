# Deploy Django on Azure

This page explains how to **deploy on Azure a simple Django Starter** generated by the service using [DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev/), a popular deployment service. 

> Here are the steps (summary)

- Access [DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev/) and register using `GitHub`
- Connect your **Azure** account
- Create a new VPS Server and wait the full deployment 
- Create a new app or simply fork this sample:
  - https://github.com/app-generator/sample-rocket-django-azure
- Complete the deployment form
- Confirm the deployment 
- Access the GitHub repository and monitor the progress (GitHub Actions)
- Visit the app in the browser. 

<br />

## Access [DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev/)

The service allows the registration using GitHub (no password required)

<br />

## Connect Azure 

In the `connections` page, users can connect to Azure via credentials.

If the operation is successfull, the connection to Azure is falled as active.

<br />

## Create new Server 

Before deploying the project, a deployment server needs to be created. This operation takes aprox. 5 minutes.

<br />

Once created, we can access the default page and also check out the details in our Azure account:

<br />

The server state can be also checked on DeployPRO.

<br />

## Deploy Django

In this phase, the user needs to provide:

- the repository 
- app name 
- path to the `Dockerfile` 
- the PORT exposed in Docker (execution entry point)
- the `DeployPRO` subdomain

Once the operation is confirmed, DeployPRO will analyze the input and update the repository with all the necessary scripts for the LIVE deployment.

<br />

## Access the APP (browser)

At this point, the Django App should be fully deployed on Azure, with an active CI/CD flow:
