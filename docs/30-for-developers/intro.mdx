# Generator - The Pattern

Rocket Generator is a tool built using a 2nd generation pattern on top of [AppSeed](https://appseed.us/). 

Here are the main improvements that makes the generator superior in most aspects: 

- [Slim-fit Codebase](#slim-fit-codebase) 
- [UI installed from libraries](#ui-external-libraries) (not hardcoded in the codebase)
- [API Generator](#api-generator) usable for any defined Model 
- [Extended User Model](#extended-user-model)
- [Models Editor](#models-editor) 
- [Deployment-Ready](#deployment-ready) via [DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev/) 

Let's say a few words about each one.

## Slim-Fit Codebase 

The AppSeed Generator provides all the features inside the starter and this makes the codebase `FAT`, sometimes with 500 files or more (up to 1k).
From the user perspective, this might not be a problem but during the GitHub upload, the process sometimes gets canceled due to the overuse of GitHub API. 

Rocket Generator uses a different pattern where all the features are libraries: UI Kits, and API Generator. 
The process simply executed the following steps: 

- Collects the user input
- Injects the configuration for the UI
- Generates the models using the definitions
- Activate the API for selected models 

With this new pattern, the most complex starter shouldn't have more than 100 files because the actual build happens on the user side during compilation.

## UI (External Libraries)

All the UI kist integrated with the generator can be used by anyone outside the service. Here are the links: 

- [Django Admin Soft](https://github.com/app-generator/django-admin-soft-dashboard) - `dashboard design`
- [Tabler](https://github.com/app-generator/django-admin-tabler) - `dashboard design`
- [Berry Bootstrap 5](https://github.com/app-generator/django-admin-berry) - `dashboard design`
- [Corporate UI](https://github.com/app-generator/django-admin-corporate) - `dashboard design`
- [Material KIT](https://github.com/app-generator/django-theme-material-kit) - `UI Kit Design`
- [Pixel Bootstrap 5](https://github.com/app-generator/django-theme-pixel) - `UI Kit Design` 

When the user selects one kit/dashboard from the above list, the generator executes the same steps on the sample codebase as the ones listed on the README. 

For instance, if the user selects [Soft Dashboard](https://github.com/app-generator/django-admin-soft-dashboard), here are the steps executed by the generator: 

- Add `django-admin-soft-dashboard` as a dependency in `requirements.txt`
- Update `configuration->INSTALLED_APPS` section:
  - Add `admin_soft.apps.AdminSoftDashboardConfig` 
- Update project routing 
  - Add `path('', include('admin_soft.urls')),` 

The above steps are executed by a custom parser that knows how to safely update the codebase, apply changes and keep the project compilable once the changes are operated.

<br />

## [API Generator](https://github.com/app-generator/django-api-generator) 

For each defined model, the user has the option to activate an API node with full CRUD access: 

- GET requests are public (get All items, get item by ID)
- Mutating Requests (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE) requires authentication 

This feature is provided via [Django API Generator](https://github.com/app-generator/django-api-generator), an open-source library built on top of `DRF`.

Regarding the generator processing, here are the steps performed for models integration:

- Add `django-api-generator` as a dependency in `requirements.txt`
- Update `configuration->INSTALLED_APPS` section:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django_api_gen',            # Django API GENERATOR  # <-- NEW
    'rest_framework',            # Include DRF           # <-- NEW 
    'rest_framework.authtoken',  # Include DRF Auth      # <-- NEW   
]
```

- Create new sections in the project settings 

```python
API_GENERATOR = {
    'MODEL_API_PATH'  : "MODEL_DEFINITION_PATH",
}

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',
        'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',
    ],
}
```

The most challenging part is to have a controlled injection for each model because the user can activate the API for a single model, all models, or none.

## Extended User Model

This feature is something that most of the Django Apps require at some point. 
To cover this point, the generator empowers the user to define a custom user model using a few defaults: 

- name
- phone 
- bio 

> Note: The API generator option is not activated in the UI.

<br />

## Models Editor 

The users can edit and design their database via a simple UI. This is unsupported on AppSeed.

<br />

## [Deployment](https://deploypro.dev/) `Ready` 

All starters generated with Docker support can be deployed via [DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev/) service using a simple flow: 

- Authenticate/register into [DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev/)
- Connect your preferred cloud provider
  - [AWS](https://www.docs.deploypro.dev/aws/intro), [Azure](https://www.docs.deploypro.dev/azure/intro) or [DigitalOcean](https://www.docs.deploypro.dev/app-platform-do/intro) 
- Create a new [VPS Server](https://www.docs.deploypro.dev/glossary/terms/vps) 
  - this operation takes ~5min 
- Deploy the GitHub Repositor (needs ownership)        

In less than 10 minutes, if the project has an usable `Dockerfile`, the project goes LIVE with an active Ci/CD flow.
