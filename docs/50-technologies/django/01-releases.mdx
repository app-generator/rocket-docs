# Django Releases

This page presensts the history of Django starting from the latest version and going backward. 

For newcomers, Django is a high-level, open-source Python web framework known for its rapid development capabilities and clean, pragmatic design.

> **Batteries-Included Philosophy**

Django follows a "batteries-included" philosophy, which means it comes with a wide range of built-in features and tools, making it easier for developers to build web applications quickly.

> **Modular and Reusable** 

Django encourages the creation of modular and reusable code through its component-based architecture, known as "apps." This promotes code organization and maintainability.

> **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)** 

Django includes a robust ORM system that allows developers to interact with databases using Python objects, abstracting away the need for complex SQL queries.

> **Admin Interface** 

Django provides an automatic admin interface for managing application data, which is a powerful tool for developers and administrators to work with the database.

> **Security** 

Django is built with security in mind and provides built-in features to protect against common web vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

> **Scalability** 

Django applications can scale from small projects to large, high-traffic websites. It offers support for database sharding, caching, and other scalability features.
