# ASGI Servers for Django

Django traditionally uses WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) servers for serving web applications. 
While Django itself has introduced [support for asynchronous code](./async-support) starting from version 3.0, 
it primarily relies on ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) servers for handling asynchronous code. ASGI is an evolution of WSGI designed to support asynchronous web applications.

> Here's a **list of ASGI Servers** that can be used with `Django` for handling asynchronous code:

## âœ… **Daphne** 

Daphne is a widely used ASGI server designed for Django applications. It's an easy choice for deploying Django applications that use async views and other asynchronous features. 
Daphne is the recommended server for Django's ASGI support.

## âœ… **Uvicorn** 

Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server that can be used to serve Django applications asynchronously. 
It's a popular choice for running Python ASGI web applications, including Django with async support.

## âœ… **Hypercorn** 

Hypercorn is another ASGI server known for its performance and compatibility with ASGI applications, including Django. It's designed to be a production-ready server and supports HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

## âœ… **ASGI Server for Nginx** 

In some production setups, you might use Nginx as a reverse proxy server in front of ASGI servers like Daphne, Uvicorn, or Hypercorn. 
Nginx can be configured to proxy requests to the ASGI server, providing a robust and scalable deployment solution for Django applications.

- Example Configuration: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/howto/deployment/asgi/nginx/

## âœ… **Starlette with an ASGI Server** 

Starlette is a lightweight ASGI framework that can be used in conjunction with an ASGI server to build async web applications. While not a server itself, it can be used with ASGI servers like Uvicorn or Hypercorn to serve Django applications asynchronously.

## âœ… **Django Channels** 

Django Channels is an extension to Django that adds support for handling real-time features like WebSockets and asynchronous code. While it's not a standalone ASGI server, it can be used in combination with ASGI servers like Daphne to handle WebSocket connections and other async features within Django.

## âœ… In Summary

When choosing an ASGI server for your Django project, consider factors such as performance, ease of configuration, and compatibility with your hosting environment. 
Additionally, always refer to the official documentation and resources for the ASGI server of your choice to ensure proper setup and deployment.
