# Python

Python is a popular and versatile programming language that's great for beginners.

Here are the fundamentals. 

## âœ… **Installation**

First, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Choose the latest version (Python 3.x).


## âœ… **A Simple Program**

Let's start with a simple "Hello, World!" program. Open a text editor (like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac) and type the following:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save this file with a `.py` extension, for example, `hello.py`.

## âœ… **Running Python Code**

Open your command-line terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux), navigate to the directory where your `hello.py` file is saved, and run the program with the following command:

```bash
python hello.py
```

You should see the output "Hello, World!".

## âœ… **Variables and Data Types**

Python supports various data types like integers, floats, strings, lists, and more. Here's an example of declaring variables:

```python
# Integer
age = 25

# Float
temperature = 98.6

# String
name = "John Doe"
```

## âœ… **Basic Operations**

Python supports standard arithmetic operations:

```python
a = 10
b = 5

sum_result = a + b
difference = a - b
product = a * b
quotient = a / b
remainder = a % b
```

## âœ… **Control Flow**

Python uses indentation for code blocks. Here's an example of an `if` statement:

```python
x = 15

if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 10")
```

## âœ… **Loops**

Python has `for` and `while` loops. Here's an example of a `for` loop:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

## âœ… **Functions**

You can define your own functions in Python:

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("Alice")
```

This is just the beginning of your journey into Python programming. There's so much more to learn, including data structures, libraries, and more advanced topics. 

As you progress, you might want to explore topics like lists, dictionaries, functions, modules, and libraries like NumPy, pandas, and more.
